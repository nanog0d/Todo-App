Note: This is a test app and contains static data only. This application was developed using Reactjs.

Feaures:

1. This app contains 2 views, Week view and List view. Week view shows all the todos created for a particular week. And the list view shows all the todos ever created.
2. The user can switch the view using the buttons at the top panel
3. Also, the user can add new todos using the "+" icon.
4. This app does not supports the edit functionality for a todo.
5. The user can delete a particular todo.
6. In the week view, the user can select a particular month, and for that particular month, the todos present in the first week of the month will be shown and not this does not includes the first day of the month, example the first week of April 2022 starts from 4th of April, so if the user changes the month from march to april, then the todos from 4th of April will be shown instead of 1st of April.
7. All the todos present in either the week view or list view are sorted in ascending order of their dates, and this order is followed even after adding a new todo or deleting a todo.
8. The app also supports the mobile resolution (Tested in chrome mobile app).
